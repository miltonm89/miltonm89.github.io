# Welcome

An introductory post of my personal blog. This will be a landing page for anyone looking to find more information about me or any projects of mine. I am still learning the basics of github pages and the jekyll blogging tools, so this post may be replaced with something else in the future.

A little about me: I am a chemical engineer from Houston, TX. I went to school at UT Austin and work in the oil and gas industry. I enjoy learning about different techologies and currently experimenting with the Julia programming language.
